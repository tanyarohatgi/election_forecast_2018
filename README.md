My forecast for the 2018 midterm elections:

Democrats take the House (approx. D-226 to R-209) but do not take the Senate (approx. R-54 to D-46). In fact, contrary to popular, cautiously optimistic claims about a Senate blue wave, I think that the Republicans will succesfully strengthen their dominance in the Senate. The Arizona, Missouri, and Indiana races in particular, currently considered toss-ups, will swing Republican. The Texas, Tennessee, and North Dakota elections, crucial to the fate of the Senate, are also leaning firmly Republican (in favour of Cruz, Blackburn, and Cramer respectively) despite early voting spikes generally believed to aid the Democrats. Trump endorsements, so-called "culture wars" and racial fearmongering, concretized bipartisanship engendered by the Kavanaugh confirmation battle, and an ostensibly booming economy reiterate and bolster faith in Republican vision and leadership.
